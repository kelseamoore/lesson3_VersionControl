            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system (VCS) records files from a project in a repository allowing the author to recall past versions of the file or files. Version control systems are beneficial for various groups, including graphic designers, web designers and web developers and are used by both individuals and teams working on a project. Teams and individuals use VCS to access past versions of a certain file in the project and see when changes to the project were made. Version control systems are specifically helpful to teams because it allows users to see who made changes to a certain file.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are several benefits to using a version control system for both teams and individuals. It allows teams to work on a project with all of the files in one common repository. The major advantage is that files cannot be overwritten, which means teams can work together on one project without worrying about accidentally deleting or changing important information. Individuals also benefit from using a VCS because you can revert back to an older version of a file. This is especially helpful if you make a mistake you cannot find, if you want to start over on a project or if you want to make a new project with similar features. VCS also serves as a backup so your project is safely saved somewhere.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When using a version control system it is important to understand the difference between the local and remote repositories. The local repository is on an individual user’s local computer. A remote repository is on a remote server that is shared amongst multiple users. Some VCS’ are local, some are remote and others incorporate local and remote features. The distributed version control system allows users to have access to the entire repository locally so that nothing is lost if the server of the remote repository is interrupted or destroyed. With this VCS, users make changes locally and push them to the remote repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a free, user-friendly distributed version control system perfect for small or large projects. Git stores information differently than most version control systems. Instead of storing information as changes recorded on a list of files, Git stores information as a snapshot of the files at the moment a change is made. This is helpful because Git does not add a new copy of a file that has not changed. Instead, it links to the previous, unchanged file and updates the new, changed file. This is much more efficient than having multiple copies of the exact same file. Because Git is a distributed VCS, each user has a complete copy of the project on their local repository and access to the remote repository on the shared server.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When using Git, it is important to understand the commands needed to make changes to a project. While there are several possible commands, there are a few commands that are very important and used most often. “Git init” creates a new repository. “Git add” starts the tracking of a new file. “Git commit” adds the change to the repository. “Git push” sends the changes on your local repository to the remote repository. “Git pull” does a fetch and merge of the remote repository to the working area. “Git status” shows a status of the working area including files that have or haven’t been tracked or committed. It is helpful to do a “git status” command often to ensure that files are being tracked or committed properly.</p>
