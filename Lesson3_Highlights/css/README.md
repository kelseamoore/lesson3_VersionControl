## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (A version control system records files from a project in a repositroy allowing the author to recall past versions of the file or files and is useful for web developers, web designers and graphic designers.)
2. (There are many benefits to using a version control system including access to older versions of a file, backup for a project and the ability for teams to work on projects together without overwriting files.)
3. (Git is a distributed version control system that is free and user-friendly. Git gives its users a complete copy of the repository on their local machine along with access to the remote repository on the server. Git is beneficial because having the repository locally prevents the possiblity of losing files or access to files from the remote repository.)
